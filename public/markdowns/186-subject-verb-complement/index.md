# Subject-Verb-Complement Patterns

Some sentences use **complements** instead of objects.

## What is a Complement?

A complement **describes or renames** the subject or object.

## Subject Complement (S + V + C)

After linking verbs, the complement describes the **subject**:

### Predicate Adjective
- *She is **tall**.*
- *The food smells **good**.*
- *He became **angry**.*

### Predicate Nominative (noun)
- *She is **a doctor**.*
- *They became **friends**.*
- *He remained **the leader**.*

## Common Linking Verbs

- **be**: *is, am, are, was, were*
- **become, remain, stay*
- **seem, appear, look*
- **feel, smell, taste, sound*

## Object Complement (S + V + O + C)

The complement describes the **object**:

- *They elected her **president**.* (her = president)
- *The news made me **happy**.* (me = happy)
- *I consider him **a friend**.* (him = friend)
- *We painted the room **blue**.* (room = blue)

## Verbs Taking Object Complements

- *make, consider, find*
- *call, name, elect*
- *paint, color, keep*

## Complement vs Object

| Object | Complement |
|--------|------------|
| Receives action | Describes S or O |
| Different from subject | Equals subject/object |
| *I saw **him**.* | *He is **tall**.* |
