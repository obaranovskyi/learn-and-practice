# Negative Questions

## Uses

### Surprise/disbelief
- **Didn't** you know? (I thought you knew!)
- **Isn't** she coming?

### Confirmation
- **Don't** you like it? (I expect you do)
- **Wouldn't** it be better to wait?

### Criticism/reproach
- **Why didn't** you tell me?
- **Why don't** you try harder?

## Forms
- **Isn't** he here? (contracted - common)
- **Is** he **not** here? (formal)

## Answering
Be careful! Answer the fact, not the question.
- "Didn't you go?" → "No, I didn't" (= I didn't go)
