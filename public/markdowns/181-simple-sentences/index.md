# Simple Sentences

A simple sentence has **one independent clause** with a subject and predicate.

## Basic Structure

**Subject + Verb (+ Object/Complement)**

- *She runs.*
- *The dog barks loudly.*
- *I love coffee.*
- *They are happy.*

## Elements

### Required
- **Subject**: who/what does the action
- **Verb**: the action or state

### Optional
- **Object**: receives the action
- **Complement**: describes subject
- **Adverbials**: when, where, how, why

## Examples by Pattern

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| S + V | *Birds sing.* |
| S + V + O | *She reads books.* |
| S + V + C | *He is tall.* |
| S + V + O + O | *She gave me a gift.* |
| S + V + O + C | *They made her happy.* |

## Compound Elements (Still Simple!)

A simple sentence can have compound parts:
- **Compound subject**: *John **and** Mary arrived.*
- **Compound verb**: *She sings **and** dances.*
- **Compound object**: *I like tea **and** coffee.*

These are still simple sentences because there's only one clause.

## Not Simple

If it has more than one clause, it's not simple:
- ✗ *I came, and she left.* (compound)
- ✗ *When I came, she left.* (complex)
