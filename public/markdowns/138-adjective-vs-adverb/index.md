# Adjective vs Adverb

Knowing when to use adjectives or adverbs is essential.

## The Basic Rule

- **Adjectives** modify nouns: *a quick response*
- **Adverbs** modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs: *respond quickly*

## Good vs Well

- **good** (adjective): *She's a good singer.*
- **well** (adverb): *She sings well.*

**Exception**: "well" as adjective = healthy
- *I don't feel well.* (= healthy)

## Common Confusions

| Adjective | Adverb | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| good | well | *She plays well.* |
| fast | fast | *He runs fast.* |
| hard | hard | *Work hard!* |
| late | late | *He arrived late.* |
| early | early | *She left early.* |

## Hard vs Hardly

- **hard** = with effort: *She works hard.*
- **hardly** = barely/almost not: *I hardly know her.*

## Late vs Lately

- **late** = not on time: *He came late.*
- **lately** = recently: *I've been busy lately.*

## After Linking Verbs

Use **adjectives** (not adverbs):
- *The food smells good.* (not: smells well)
- *She looks beautiful.* (not: looks beautifully)
- *I feel bad.* (not: feel badly)
