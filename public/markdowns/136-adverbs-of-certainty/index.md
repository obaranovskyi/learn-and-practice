# Adverbs of Certainty

Adverbs of certainty show how sure we are about something.

## Certainty Scale

| Adverb | Certainty |
|--------|-----------|
| definitely, certainly | 100% |
| clearly, obviously | 95% |
| probably, likely | 75% |
| possibly, perhaps, maybe | 50% |
| unlikely | 25% |

## Position

### Mid-position (most common)
- *She **definitely** knows the answer.*
- *They **probably** won't come.*
- *He **certainly** tried hard.*

### Beginning (for emphasis)
- ***Obviously**, he's lying.*
- ***Probably**, it will rain.*
- ***Maybe** I'll go.*

### End position
- *She knows the answer, **definitely**.*
- *It's true, **obviously**.*

## Perhaps vs Maybe

- Both mean ~50% certainty
- **perhaps** = more formal
- **maybe** = more informal

## With Modals

- *He **will definitely** come.*
- *She **probably won't** help.*
- *They **might possibly** agree.*

## Common Patterns

- *almost certainly*
- *most likely/probably*
- *quite possibly*
- *definitely not*
