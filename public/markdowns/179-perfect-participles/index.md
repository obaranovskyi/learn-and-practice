# Perfect Participles (Having Done)

Perfect participles show that one action was completed **before** another.

## Formation

**having + past participle**

- *having finished*
- *having eaten*
- *having arrived*
- *having seen*

## Active Perfect Participle

- ***Having finished** the work, she relaxed.*
  (= After she had finished...)
- ***Having read** the book, I returned it.*
  (= After I had read...)
- ***Having lived** there for years, he knew everyone.*
  (= Because he had lived...)

## Passive Perfect Participle

**having been + past participle**

- ***Having been warned**, he was careful.*
  (= After he had been warned...)
- ***Having been invited**, she attended.*
  (= Because she had been invited...)

## When to Use

Use perfect participles when:
1. First action is clearly **before** second
2. First action is **completed**
3. There's a clear **cause-effect** relationship

## Comparison

| Simple Participle | Perfect Participle |
