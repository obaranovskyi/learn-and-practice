# Suppose / Supposing / What if

## Meaning: Imagine if... / What would happen if...

## Real situations (present/future)
- **Suppose** you miss the train, what will you do?
- **What if** it rains?

## Unreal situations (like 2nd/3rd conditional)
- **Supposing** you won the lottery, what would you do?
- **What if** we had never met?

## Can replace "if" in conditionals
- **Suppose** I asked you to marry me? (= If I asked...)
- **What if** she doesn't come? (= If she doesn't come)
