# Superlative Adjectives

Superlatives compare three or more things to show the highest degree.

## Formation Rules

### Short Adjectives: Add -est
- *tall → the tallest*
- *fast → the fastest*
- *old → the oldest*

### Spelling Changes
- **Consonant + y → iest**: *happy → the happiest*
- **Double final consonant**: *big → the biggest*
- **-e endings**: *nice → the nicest*

### Long Adjectives: Use "the most"
- *beautiful → the most beautiful*
- *expensive → the most expensive*
- *interesting → the most interesting*

## Always Use "the"

- *She is **the** tallest in the class.*
- *It's **the** most expensive car here.*

## Exceptions with Possessives

- *my best friend* (not: the my best)
- *his greatest achievement*

## Structure

**Subject + be + the + superlative + (in/of)**
- *She is the smartest in the class.*
- *He's the tallest of all the brothers.*

## In vs Of

- **in** + places/groups: *the best in the world*
- **of** + quantities: *the oldest of the three*
