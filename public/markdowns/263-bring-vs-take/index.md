# Bring vs Take

Both mean carrying something, but direction differs.

## Bring = Toward speaker/here

Movement toward the speaker's location:
- ***Bring** me the book.* (to where I am)
- *Can you **bring** wine to the party?* (to where we'll be)
- *She **brought** her friend to my house.*
- ***Bring** it here.*

## Take = Away from speaker/there

Movement away from the speaker's location:
- ***Take** this to the office.* (away from here)
- *Don't forget to **take** your umbrella.* (when leaving)
- *I'll **take** you home.* (away from here)
- ***Take** it there.*

## Think: Come vs Go

- **Bring** = come with → toward
- **Take** = go with → away

## Examples

| Situation | Correct |
|-----------|---------|
| To someone visiting you | "Bring your ID" |
| Before leaving home | "Take your keys" |
| At a party you're hosting | "Bring a dish" |
| Sending something away | "Take this to mom" |

## Context Matters

The speaker's perspective determines choice:
- At home: "*Bring* me coffee" (to where I am)
- At café: "*Take* this coffee to table 5" (away from counter)

## Similar Pairs

- Come/Go: same direction concept
- Fetch: go, get, and bring back

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ *Don't forget to bring your umbrella when you leave.*
- ✅ *Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave.*
