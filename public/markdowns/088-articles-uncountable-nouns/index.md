# Articles with Uncountable Nouns

Uncountable nouns follow different article rules than countable nouns.

## Key Rules

1. **Never use a/an** with uncountable nouns
2. **Use "the"** when specific
3. **No article** when general

## Examples

| General (no article) | Specific (the) |
|---------------------|----------------|
| *Water is essential.* | *The water in this glass is cold.* |
| *I love music.* | *The music at the party was loud.* |
| *Money doesn't buy happiness.* | *The money I saved is enough.* |

## Common Uncountable Categories

- **Liquids**: water, milk, coffee, oil
- **Materials**: wood, gold, paper, glass
- **Abstract**: love, happiness, information, advice
- **Food substances**: rice, bread, sugar, flour

## Making Uncountable Nouns Countable

Use quantity expressions:
- *a piece of advice/information/furniture*
- *a glass of water/milk*
- *a slice of bread/pizza*
