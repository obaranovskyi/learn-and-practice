# Reduced Relative Clauses

Relative clauses can be shortened to participle phrases.

## Present Participle (-ing)

**Active meaning** - remove "who/which is/are" + use -ing:
- *The man **who is standing** there...* → *The man **standing** there...*
- *Students **who study** hard...* → *Students **studying** hard...*
- *The car **which is blocking** the road...* → *The car **blocking** the road...*

## Past Participle (-ed/3rd form)

**Passive meaning** - remove "who/which is/are":
- *The book **which was written** by her...* → *The book **written** by her...*
- *The man **who was injured**...* → *The man **injured**...*
- *Food **which is cooked** properly...* → *Food **cooked** properly...*
