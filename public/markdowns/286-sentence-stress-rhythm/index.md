# Sentence Stress and Rhythm

English is a stress-timed language with rhythmic patterns.

## Content vs Function Words

### Content words (stressed)
Carry meaning:
- Nouns: book, teacher
- Verbs: run, think
- Adjectives: big, beautiful
- Adverbs: quickly, very
- Question words: what, where

### Function words (unstressed)
Grammar words:
- Articles: a, an, the
- Prepositions: to, at, in
- Pronouns: he, she, it
- Auxiliaries: is, have, can
- Conjunctions: and, but

## Example

*"I **WENT** to the **STORE** and **BOUGHT** some **BREAD**."*

(went, store, bought, bread = stressed)
(I, to, the, and, some = unstressed)

## Rhythm

Equal time between stresses:
- "**CATS** chase **MICE**" (2 stresses)
- "The **CATS** will **CHASE** the **MICE**" (3 stresses, same speed)

Function words get squeezed between stresses.

## Reduced Forms

Unstressed words often reduce:
- "to" → /tə/
- "and" → /ən/ or /n/
- "can" → /kən/
- "the" → /ðə/
- "for" → /fər/

## Changing Meaning with Stress

- ***I*** didn't steal the money. (someone else did)
- *I* ***DIDN'T*** steal the money. (denial)
- *I didn't* ***STEAL*** the money. (I borrowed it)
- *I didn't steal* ***THE*** money. (some other money)

## Contrastive Stress

Emphasizing to contrast:
- A: "Did John buy it?" B: "No, **MARY** bought it."
