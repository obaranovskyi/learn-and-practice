# Preposition + Gerund

## Rule: After prepositions, use -ing

## Common patterns
- **interested in** doing
- **good at** doing
- **afraid of** doing
- **tired of** doing
- **instead of** doing
- **before/after** doing
- **without** doing

## Examples
- She's good **at singing**.
- I'm tired **of waiting**.
- He left **without saying** goodbye.
- **Before leaving**, check the door.
- **After finishing**, we went home.

## Note: "to" as preposition
When "to" is a preposition (not infinitive):
- I look forward **to seeing** you.
- I'm used **to working** late.
