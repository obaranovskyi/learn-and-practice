# Articles: A, An, The

Articles are small words with big importance. They help us specify whether we're talking about something general or specific.

## The Three Articles

| Article | Type | Use |
|---------|------|-----|
| **a** | Indefinite | Before consonant sounds |
| **an** | Indefinite | Before vowel sounds |
| **the** | Definite | Specific reference |

## Indefinite Articles: A / An

### When to Use
Used when mentioning something for the **first time** or when it's **one of many**.

- I saw **a** dog in the park. (any dog, not specific)
- She's **an** engineer. (one of many engineers)
- Can I have **a** coffee? (one coffee)

### A vs An
Based on **sound**, not spelling!

| Use A | Use An |
|-------|--------|
| a car, a book | an apple, an egg |
| a university (sounds like "you") | an hour (silent h) |
