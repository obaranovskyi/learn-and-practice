# Participle Clauses (Replacing Adverb Clauses)

Participle clauses can replace adverb clauses of time, reason, and condition.

## Time (When/While/After/Before)

- ***When I arrived**, I called you.* → ***Arriving**, I called you.*
- ***While she was waiting**, she read.* → ***Waiting**, she read.*
- ***After he finished**, he left.* → ***Having finished**, he left.*

## Reason (Because/As/Since)

- ***Because she was tired**, she rested.* → ***Being tired**, she rested.*
- ***Since I didn't know**, I asked.* → ***Not knowing**, I asked.*
- ***As he was ill**, he stayed home.* → ***Being ill**, he stayed home.*

## Passive Meaning

- ***Because it was built** in 1800...* → ***Built** in 1800...*
- ***Since she was invited**...* → ***Invited**...*

## With Conjunctions (Optional)

Keep the conjunction for clarity:
- ***While walking** home, I saw him.*
- ***When asked**, she refused.*
- ***Although knowing** the risk, he continued.*

## Rules

- Same subject in both clauses
- Present participle = active/same time
- Past participle = passive
- Having + past participle = earlier time

## Common Patterns

| Full | Reduced |
|------|---------|
| Because I was tired | Being tired |
| While he was walking | While walking |
| After she had eaten | Having eaten |
| Since it was built | Built |
