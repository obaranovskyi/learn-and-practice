# Articles with Institutions

Article usage depends on whether we mean the **purpose** or the **building**.

## No Article (Purpose)

When we refer to the typical purpose:

| Word | Purpose Example |
|------|-----------------|
| school | *go to school* (to study) |
| university | *at university* (studying) |
| church | *go to church* (to worship) |
| prison/jail | *in prison* (as prisoner) |
| hospital | *in hospital* (as patient) - BrE |
| bed | *go to bed* (to sleep) |
| work | *at work* (working) |

## Use "the" (Building/Specific)

When referring to the physical place or a specific visit:

- *The school was built in 1990.* (building)
- *I went to the hospital to visit my friend.* (visiting, not patient)
- *The church on Main Street is beautiful.* (specific building)
