# Apostrophes

Apostrophes show possession or omission.

## Possession

### Singular nouns: add 's
- *the dog's bone*
- *James's car* or *James' car* (both correct)
- *the boss's office*

### Plural nouns ending in s: add '
- *the dogs' bones* (multiple dogs)
- *the teachers' room*
- *the Smiths' house*

### Irregular plurals: add 's
- *the children's toys*
- *the women's room*
- *the people's choice*

## Contractions

Apostrophe replaces missing letters:
- *don't* = do not
- *can't* = cannot
- *it's* = it is / it has
- *they're* = they are
- *I'm* = I am
- *would've* = would have

## Common Mistakes

### It's vs Its
- *It's* = it is → *It's raining.*
- *Its* = belonging to it → *The cat licked its paw.*

### They're / Their / There
- *They're* = they are
- *Their* = possession
- *There* = place

### You're vs Your
- *You're* = you are
- *Your* = possession

## NOT for Plurals
- ❌ *Apple's for sale* → ✅ *Apples for sale*
- ❌ *The 1990's* → ✅ *The 1990s*
