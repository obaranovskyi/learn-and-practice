# Double Comparatives

Double comparatives show parallel increase or decrease.

## The More...The More

**the + comparative, the + comparative**

- ***The more** you practice, **the better** you get.*
- ***The harder** you work, **the more** you earn.*
- ***The older** I get, **the wiser** I become.*
- ***The more expensive** the car, **the faster** it goes.*

## Common Patterns

- *The sooner, the better.*
- *The bigger, the better.*
- *The more, the merrier.*
- *The less said, the better.*

## Getting + Comparative

Shows gradual change:
- *It's getting colder and colder.*
- *She's becoming more and more successful.*
- *The situation is getting worse and worse.*
- *Prices are rising higher and higher.*

## Both Structures Combined

- *The more I learn, the more confused I get.*
- *The longer we waited, the more nervous we became.*
- *The harder he tried, the more mistakes he made.*

## Without Verbs

Shorter, more idiomatic:
- *The sooner, the better.* (= The sooner you do it, the better it will be)
- *The more, the merrier.* (= The more people, the merrier it is)
