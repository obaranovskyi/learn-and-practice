# The Basics

Now that you're familiar with the platform, let's cover some fundamental concepts.

## Core Concepts

Understanding the basics is essential before moving to advanced topics.

### Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values:

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
const age = 25;
var city = "New York";
```

### Data Types

Common data types include:

- **String** - Text values like `"Hello"`
- **Number** - Numeric values like `42` or `3.14`
- **Boolean** - `true` or `false`
- **Array** - Lists like `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Object** - Key-value pairs like `{ name: "Alice" }`

## Working with Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet("World");
console.log(message); // "Hello, World!"
```

### Arrow Functions

Modern syntax for writing functions:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const square = x => x * x;
```

## Summary

- Variables store data
- Different data types serve different purposes
- Functions make code reusable
