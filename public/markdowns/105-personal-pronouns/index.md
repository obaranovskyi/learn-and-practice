# Personal Pronouns (Subject)

Personal pronouns replace nouns and act as subjects of sentences.

## Subject Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | I | we |
| 2nd | you | you |
| 3rd | he, she, it | they |

## Usage

Subject pronouns come **before** the verb:
- *I am a teacher.*
- *She works in London.*
- *They are coming tomorrow.*
- *It is raining.*

## Notes

- **I** is always capitalized
- **You** is the same for singular and plural
- **It** refers to things, animals, or unspecified
- **They** can be singular (gender-neutral): *Someone left their bag.*

## Common Mistakes

- ✗ *Me and John went to the store.*
- ✓ *John and I went to the store.*

- ✗ *Her is my friend.*
- ✓ *She is my friend.*

## After "be"

Formal: *It is I.* / *It was she.*
Common: *It's me.* / *It was her.*
