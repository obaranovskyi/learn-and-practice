# Short Answers

Polite, natural responses without repeating the full sentence.

## Basic Pattern

Yes/No + subject + auxiliary (no main verb)

### Be
- *Are you ready?* - "Yes, I am." / "No, I'm not."
- *Is she coming?* - "Yes, she is." / "No, she isn't."

### Do/Does/Did
- *Do you like it?* - "Yes, I do." / "No, I don't."
- *Did he call?* - "Yes, he did." / "No, he didn't."

### Have
- *Have you seen it?* - "Yes, I have." / "No, I haven't."

### Modal Verbs
- *Can you swim?* - "Yes, I can." / "No, I can't."
- *Will she come?* - "Yes, she will." / "No, she won't."

## Why Short Answers?

- Just "Yes" or "No" sounds abrupt/rude
- Repeating full answer sounds unnatural:
  - ❌ "Do you like coffee?" - "Yes, I like coffee."
  - ✅ "Do you like coffee?" - "Yes, I do."

## Extended Short Answers

Adding information:
- "Yes, I am. Why do you ask?"
- "No, I don't, actually."
- "Yes, I have. It was great!"

## Agreeing/Disagreeing

- *I'm tired.* - "So am I." / "I am too."
- *I don't like it.* - "Neither do I." / "I don't either."

## No Contraction in Positive

- ✅ "Yes, I am."
- ❌ "Yes, I'm."
- ✅ "No, I'm not." (negative OK)
