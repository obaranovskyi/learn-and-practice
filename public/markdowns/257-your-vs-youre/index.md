# Your vs You're

Another very common confusion.

## You're = You are

Contraction:
- ***You're** welcome.* = You are welcome
- ***You're** right.* = You are right
- ***You're** coming, aren't you?* = You are coming
- ***You're** the best!* = You are the best

## Your = Possession

Belonging to "you":
- *Is this **your** book?*
- *What's **your** name?*
- ***Your** car is outside.*
- *I like **your** idea.*

## Memory Trick

**Test**: Can you replace with "you are"?
- ✅ Yes → Use **you're**
- ❌ No → Use **your**

## Examples

| Sentence | Test | Correct |
|----------|------|---------|
| ___ late | You are late ✅ | You're |
| Is this ___ bag? | You are bag ❌ | your |
| ___ amazing | You are amazing ✅ | You're |
| ___ friend called | You are friend ❌ | your |

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ *Your the best!*
- ✅ *You're the best!*
- ❌ *Is this you're book?*
- ✅ *Is this your book?*
