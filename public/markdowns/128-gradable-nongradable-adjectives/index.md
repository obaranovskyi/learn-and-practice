# Gradable vs Non-gradable Adjectives

## Gradable Adjectives

Can be modified in degree (very, quite, rather, etc.):
- *very happy, quite cold, rather tall*
- Can be comparative: *happier, colder, taller*

## Non-gradable (Extreme/Absolute)

|----------|----------------------|
| hot | boiling, scorching |
| cold | freezing |
| tired | exhausted |
| hungry | starving |
| angry | furious |
| big | enormous, huge |
| small | tiny |
| good | perfect, excellent |
