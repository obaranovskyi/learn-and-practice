# Dangling Participles (Common Mistakes)

A dangling participle occurs when the participle phrase doesn't logically connect to the subject.

## The Problem

The subject of the participle must be the same as the subject of the main clause.

### Incorrect (Dangling)
- ✗ ***Walking** to work, **the rain** started.*
  (The rain wasn't walking!)
- ✗ ***Having finished** dinner, **the TV** was turned on.*
  (The TV didn't finish dinner!)

### Correct
- ✓ ***Walking** to work, **I** got wet when the rain started.*
- ✓ ***Having finished** dinner, **we** turned on the TV.*

## Common Dangling Patterns

### With Passive Main Clause
- ✗ *Driving home, the accident was seen.*
- ✓ *Driving home, I saw the accident.*

### With "There is/It is"
- ✗ *Looking out the window, there was a bird.*
- ✓ *Looking out the window, I saw a bird.*

### With Impersonal Subjects
- ✗ *Being a holiday, the shops were closed.*
- ✓ *It being a holiday, the shops were closed.*
- ✓ *Since it was a holiday, the shops were closed.*

## How to Fix

1. **Change the subject** of the main clause
2. **Rewrite** as a full adverb clause
3. Use **absolute construction** (It being...)

## Quick Test

Ask: "Who is [participle]-ing?"
- *Walking to work, the rain started.* → Who was walking? The rain? No!
- *Walking to work, I got wet.* → Who was walking? I. ✓
