# Adverb Position in Sentences

Different adverbs have different typical positions.

## Three Main Positions

1. **Front** (beginning): *Yesterday, I went shopping.*
2. **Mid** (before main verb/after be/aux): *I often go shopping.*
3. **End** (after verb/object): *I went shopping yesterday.*

## Position by Type

| Type | Typical Position | Example |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Frequency | Mid | *I always eat breakfast.* |
| Manner | End | *She spoke quietly.* |
| Place | End | *They live nearby.* |
| Time | End/Front | *I'll see you tomorrow.* |
| Degree | Before adj/adv | *It's very cold.* |
| Certainty | Mid | *He probably knows.* |

## Mid-Position Rules

**Before** main verb:
- *She **often** visits.*

**After** be:
- *He is **always** late.*

**After** first auxiliary:
- *I have **never** been there.*
- *She will **probably** come.*

## Order When Multiple Adverbs

**Manner → Place → Time**
- *She sang beautifully (M) in the hall (P) last night (T).*

## Flexibility for Emphasis

Moving to front adds emphasis:
- *Suddenly, the door opened.* (dramatic)
- *Never have I seen such beauty.* (inversion for emphasis)
