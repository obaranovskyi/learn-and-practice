# Indirect Questions

## More polite than direct questions

## Structure
Intro phrase + question word + **statement order**

## Examples
- Direct: Where is the bank?
- Indirect: Could you tell me **where the bank is**?

- Direct: What time does it start?
- Indirect: Do you know **what time it starts**?

## Intro phrases
- Could you tell me...
- Do you know...
- I wonder...
- I'd like to know...

## Key: No auxiliary inversion in the embedded question
❌ Do you know where is it?
✅ Do you know where it is?
