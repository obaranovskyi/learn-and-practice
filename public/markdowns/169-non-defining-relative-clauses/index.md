# Non-defining Relative Clauses

Non-defining relative clauses give extra, non-essential information.

## Key Features

- **Extra** information (not needed to identify)
- **Always have commas**
- Use **who, which, whose** (NOT "that")
- Relative pronoun **cannot be omitted**

## Examples

- *My brother, **who lives in Paris**, is a doctor.*
- *The Eiffel Tower, **which was built in 1889**, is famous.*
- *John, **whose car was stolen**, called the police.*

## Without the clause, meaning is still clear:
- *My brother is a doctor.* (clear - only one brother)

## Cannot Use "That"

- ✓ *Paris, **which** I visited, is beautiful.*
- ✗ *Paris, **that** I visited, is beautiful.*

## Always Commas

- ✓ *My car, which is red, is in the garage.*
- ✗ *My car which is red is in the garage.* (this = defining)

## Whole Clause Reference

"Which" can refer to a whole clause:
- *He passed the exam, **which** surprised everyone.*
- *She quit her job, **which** was unexpected.*
