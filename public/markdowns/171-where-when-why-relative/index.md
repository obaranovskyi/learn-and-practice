# Where, When, Why in Relative Clauses

These relative adverbs replace "preposition + which."

## Where (Place)

- *That's the house **where** I was born.*
  (= in which)
- *The city **where** we met is beautiful.*
- *I know a place **where** we can eat.*

## When (Time)

- *I remember the day **when** we met.*
  (= on which)
- *That was the year **when** he graduated.*
- *Summer is the time **when** I relax.*

## Why (Reason)

- *That's the reason **why** I left.*
  (= for which)
- *I don't know the reason **why** she's angry.*
- *Tell me **why** you did it.*

## Alternatives

| Relative Adverb | Equivalent |
|-----------------|------------|
| where | in/at which |
| when | in/on/at which |
| why | for which |

## Omitting "Why"

"Why" can often be omitted:
- *That's the reason (why) I came.*
- *Is there a reason (why) you're late?*

## "Way" + How

Note: "how" is NOT used as a relative adverb. Use "way":
- ✓ *I like the **way** (that) she talks.*
- ✗ *I like **how** she talks.* (different meaning - okay in some contexts)

## Examples

- *The hotel **where** we stayed was cheap.*
- *Monday is the day **when** I'm busiest.*
- *I understand the reason **why** you're upset.*
