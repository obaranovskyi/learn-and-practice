# Lay vs Lie

One of the trickiest confusions in English.

Forms: lay - laid - laid - laying

## Lie (Intransitive - no object)

To recline/be in position:
- *I need to **lie** down.*
- *He **lay** on the bed yesterday.*
- *She has **lain** there for hours.*

Forms: lie - lay - lain - lying

## The Confusion

Past tense of "lie" is "lay"!

| Verb | Present | Past | Past Part. | -ing |
|------|---------|------|------------|------|
| Lay | lay | laid | laid | laying |
| Lie | lie | lay | lain | lying |

## Quick Test
