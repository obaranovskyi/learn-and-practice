# Prepositions in Relative Clauses

Prepositions can appear in different positions in relative clauses.

## Two Positions

### 1. At the End (Informal)
- *The person **(who) I spoke to** was helpful.*
- *That's the chair **(which) she sat on**.*
- *The topic **(that) we talked about** is important.*

### 2. Before the Pronoun (Formal)
- *The person **to whom** I spoke was helpful.*
- *That's the chair **on which** she sat.*
- *The topic **about which** we talked is important.*

## Rules

### Formal Style (Prep + Whom/Which)
- Use **whom** for people (not who)
- Use **which** for things (not that)
- *The person **to whom** I gave it...*
- *The reason **for which** he left...*

### Informal Style (Prep at End)
- Can use who, that, or omit
- *The person I gave it **to**...*
- *The reason he left **for**...*

## Cannot Use "That" After Preposition

- ✗ *The person to **that** I spoke...*
- ✓ *The person to **whom** I spoke...*
- ✓ *The person (that) I spoke **to**...*
