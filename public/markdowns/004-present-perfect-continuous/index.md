# Present Perfect Continuous

The Present Perfect Continuous emphasizes the duration of an activity that started in the past and continues to the present (or recently stopped).

## Form

**Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing**

### Affirmative
| Subject | Have/Has | Been | Verb-ing |
|---------|----------|------|----------|
| I / You / We / They | have | been | working |
| He / She / It | has | been | working |

### Negative
- I **haven't been** working
- She **hasn't been** working

### Question
- **Have** you **been** working?
- **Has** she **been** working?

## Uses

### 1. Duration of Activity (How long?)
Actions that started in the past and continue until now.

- I **have been waiting** for an hour.
- She **has been studying** English since January.
- How long **have** you **been living** here?

### 2. Recent Continuous Activity (with visible results)
Actions that recently stopped, with visible evidence.

- You're out of breath. **Have** you **been running**?
- His eyes are red. He **has been crying**.
- The ground is wet. It **has been raining**.

### 3. Emphasis on Duration
When you want to emphasize how long something has been happening.

- I **have been trying** to call you all day!
- We **have been working** on this project for months.

## Present Perfect Simple vs Continuous

| Present Perfect Simple | Present Perfect Continuous |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Focus on **result/completion** | Focus on **duration/activity** |
| I've read 3 books this month. | I've been reading a lot lately. |
| She's written the report. | She's been writing all morning. |
| How many pages have you read? | How long have you been reading? |

### When to Use Each

**Use Simple for:**
- Completed actions: I've finished my homework.
- Number/quantity: I've written three emails.
- Permanent situations: I've known her for years.

**Use Continuous for:**
- Ongoing actions: I've been doing my homework (still doing it).
- Emphasis on duration: I've been working all day.
- Temporary situations: I've been staying with friends.

## Time Expressions

- for + duration (for two hours, for ages)
- since + starting point (since morning, since 2020)
- all day/week/morning
- lately, recently
- How long...?

## Common Mistakes

❌ I have been knowing him for years.  
✅ I **have known** him for years. (know is stative)

❌ She has been working here since 3 years.  
✅ She has been working here **for** 3 years.

❌ I've been reading three books this month.  
✅ I've **read** three books this month. (counting = Simple)
