# Who vs Whom

**Who** = subject, **Whom** = object (like he/him).

## Who (Subject)

Does the action:
- ***Who** called you?* (He called you)
- ***Who** is coming?* (She is coming)
- *The man **who** helped me...*

## Whom (Object)

Receives the action:
- ***Whom** did you call?* (You called him)
- *To **whom** it may concern*
- *The man **whom** I met...*

## Memory Trick

**He/Him Test**:
- Answer with "he" → **who**
- Answer with "him" → **whom**

Examples:
- *Who/Whom called?* → "He called" → **Who**
- *Who/Whom did you see?* → "I saw him" → **Whom**

**M trick**: who**M** = hi**M** (both end in M)

## After Prepositions

Formal: **whom** after prepositions
- *To **whom** did you speak?*
- *With **whom** are you going?*
- *For **whom** is this gift?*

Informal: preposition at end, "who" OK
- ***Who** did you speak to?*
- ***Who** are you going with?*

## Modern Usage

- **Whom** is becoming less common
- Often sounds formal/old-fashioned
- **Who** increasingly used in all positions
- **Whom** still expected in formal writing
