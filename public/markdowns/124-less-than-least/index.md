# Less...Than / The Least

Use **less** and **least** to compare downward (opposite of more/most).

## Less + Adjective + Than

- *This is **less expensive than** that.*
- *The movie was **less interesting than** the book.*
- *He's **less confident than** his brother.*

## The Least + Adjective

- *This is **the least expensive** option.*
- *That was **the least interesting** part.*
- *He's **the least experienced** member.*

## Less vs Fewer

- **less** + uncountable: *less water, less time*
- **fewer** + countable: *fewer people, fewer books*

## Less vs Not As

Both express similar meaning:
- *This is less expensive than that.*
- *This is not as expensive as that.*

But "not as...as" is more common for short adjectives:
- ✓ *He's not as tall as me.* (natural)
- ? *He's less tall than me.* (awkward)

## Common Expressions

- *more or less* (approximately)
- *the less...the better*
- *no less than* (emphasis)
- *at least*
- *least of all*
- *not in the least* (not at all)
