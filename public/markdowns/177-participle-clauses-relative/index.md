# Participle Clauses (Replacing Relative Clauses)

Participle clauses can replace relative clauses to make sentences shorter.

## Present Participle (Active Meaning)

Remove "who/which + be" or change verb to -ing:

- *The man **who is standing** there...* → *The man **standing** there...*
- *People **who live** here...* → *People **living** here...*
- *The car **which is blocking** the road...* → *The car **blocking** the road...*

## Past Participle (Passive Meaning)

Remove "who/which + be":

- *The book **which was written** by him...* → *The book **written** by him...*
- *The house **which was built** in 1900...* → *The house **built** in 1900...*
- *Food **which is cooked** properly...* → *Food **cooked** properly...*

## Rules

### Can Reduce When:
- The relative pronoun is the **subject**
- For present participle: active meaning
- For past participle: passive meaning

### Cannot Reduce:
- When pronoun is object: *The book (that) I read* ✗
- When meaning would be unclear
