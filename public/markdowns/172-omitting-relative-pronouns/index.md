# Omitting Relative Pronouns

In some cases, the relative pronoun can be left out.

## When to Omit

### In Defining Clauses When Pronoun is OBJECT

- *The book **(that)** I bought is great.*
- *The man **(who/whom)** I met was kind.*
- *The movie **(which)** we watched was boring.*

The pronoun is object when another subject follows:
- *The book **I** bought* (I = subject of bought)

### Cannot Omit When Pronoun is SUBJECT

- ✓ *The man **who** called is here.* (who = subject)
- ✗ *The man called is here.*

## Test: Can You Omit?

If there's a subject right after the relative pronoun, you can usually omit:
- *The car (that) **he** drives...* ✓ (he = subject → omit)
- *The car that **is** expensive...* ✗ (that = subject → keep)

## Never Omit In

1. **Non-defining clauses**:
   - ✗ *My brother, lives in Paris, is a doctor.*
   - ✓ *My brother, **who** lives in Paris, is a doctor.*

2. **After prepositions**:
   - ✗ *The person to I spoke...*
   - ✓ *The person to **whom** I spoke...*
   - ✓ *The person (who) I spoke **to**...* (informal)

3. **When pronoun is subject**:
   - ✓ *The man **who** came...*
   - ✗ *The man came...*
