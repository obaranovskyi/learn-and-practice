# Subject vs Object Questions

## Object Questions (normal)
Wh-word asks about the object → use auxiliary

- **What** did you buy? (You bought **something**)
- **Who** did you see? (You saw **someone**)

## Subject Questions (no auxiliary)
Wh-word asks about the subject → no auxiliary needed

- **Who** called? (**Someone** called)
- **What** happened? (**Something** happened)

## Compare
- **Who** did you call? (object - you called who?)
- **Who** called you? (subject - who did the action?)
