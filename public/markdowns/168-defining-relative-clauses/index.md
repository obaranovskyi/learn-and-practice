# Defining Relative Clauses

Defining relative clauses give essential information that identifies the noun.

## Key Features

- **Essential** information (needed to identify)
- **No commas**
- Can use **who, which, that**
- Relative pronoun can sometimes be **omitted**

## Examples

- *The man **who called** is my brother.* (which man?)
- *The book **that I bought** is interesting.* (which book?)
- *The car **which/that was stolen** was found.* (which car?)

## Without the clause, meaning is unclear:
- *The man is my brother.* (Which man?)

## Relative Pronouns

| For | Pronouns |
|-----|----------|
| People | who, that |
| Things | which, that |
| Possession | whose |
| Place | where |
| Time | when |

## "That" vs "Who/Which"

**That** is often preferred:
- After superlatives: *the best **that** I've seen*
- After all, any, every, no: *everything **that** he said*
- After it is/was: *It was John **that** told me*

## No Commas

- ✓ *The woman who lives here is nice.*
- ✗ *The woman, who lives here, is nice.* (this = non-defining)
