# Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement

Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number, gender, and person.

## What is an Antecedent?

The noun a pronoun refers to:
- ***John** lost **his** keys.* (John = antecedent, his = pronoun)

## Basic Rules

### Number Agreement
- Singular: ***The girl** lost **her** book.*
- Plural: ***The girls** lost **their** books.*

### Gender Agreement
- *John brought **his** lunch.*
- *Mary brought **her** lunch.*
- *The team won **its** game.*

## Indefinite Pronoun Antecedents

### Singular (use he/she/they)
- *Everyone should bring **his or her** book.*
- *Everyone should bring **their** book.* (acceptable now)
- *Each student must submit **their** work.*

### Plural
- ***Many** brought **their** lunches.*
- ***Both** finished **their** work.*

## Collective Noun Antecedents

- *The team won **its** final game.* (team as unit)
- *The team argued among **themselves**.* (team as individuals)

## Common Mistakes

- ✗ *Everyone brought their books.* (traditional rule)
- ✓ *Everyone brought his or her book.* (traditional)
- ✓ *Everyone brought their book.* (modern, accepted)

## Clarity

Avoid ambiguous references:
- ✗ *John told Tom that **he** was wrong.* (Who is 'he'?)
- ✓ *John told Tom, "You are wrong."*
