# By vs Until

## By

**Meaning**: not later than, at or before
**Focus**: deadline, completion point

- *Finish the report **by** Friday.* (Friday or before)
- *I'll be there **by** 5 pm.* (5 pm or earlier)
- *The package should arrive **by** tomorrow.*
- *Applications must be submitted **by** the 31st.*

**Used with**: points in time (a deadline)

## Until (Till)

**Meaning**: up to a point in time
**Focus**: duration, continuing action

- *I'll wait **until** 6 o'clock.* (from now to 6)
- *The shop is open **until** 9 pm.* (closes at 9)
- *I worked **until** midnight.*
- *Stay here **until** I come back.*

**Used with**: continuous situations/actions
