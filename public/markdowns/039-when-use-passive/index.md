# When to Use Passive

## Use passive when:

### 1. Agent is unknown
- My car **was stolen**. (don't know who)

### 2. Agent is obvious
- The thief **was arrested**. (obviously by police)

### 3. Agent is unimportant
- The road **is being repaired**. (focus on road, not workers)

### 4. To be impersonal/formal
- Smoking **is not permitted**. (rules, signs)

### 5. To shift focus
- The Mona Lisa **was painted** by Da Vinci. (focus on painting)

## When NOT to use passive
- With intransitive verbs (happen, arrive, die)
- When active is clearer and shorter
