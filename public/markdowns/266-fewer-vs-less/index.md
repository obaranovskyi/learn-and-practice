# Fewer vs Less

**Fewer** = countable, **Less** = uncountable.

## Fewer (Countable)

Things you can count:
- ***Fewer** people came today.*
- *I have **fewer** books than you.*
- *There are **fewer** cars on the road.*
- ***Fewer** than 10 students passed.*

## Less (Uncountable)

Things you can't count:
- *I have **less** time today.*
- *There's **less** water in the glass.*
- *We need **less** sugar.*
- *She has **less** experience.*

## Memory Trick

- **Fewer** = **F**or things you can count (numbers)
- **Less** = **L**iquid-like (mass nouns)

Or: Fewer for "how many," Less for "how much"

## Exceptions

### "Less" with numbers (informal)
- *"10 items or less"* (common but contested)
- Strictly: *"10 items or fewer"*

### Time/Money/Distance (units)
- *less than $50* (money as single amount)
- *less than 5 miles* (distance as amount)
- *less than 2 hours* (time as amount)

## Examples

| Countable (Fewer) | Uncountable (Less) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| fewer people | less population |
| fewer dollars | less money |
| fewer minutes | less time |
| fewer problems | less trouble |

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ *Less people came.*
- ✅ *Fewer people came.*
- ❌ *I have fewer money.*
- ✅ *I have less money.*
