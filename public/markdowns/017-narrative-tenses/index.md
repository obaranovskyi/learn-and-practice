# Narrative Tenses

## Main Tenses in Stories

### Simple Past (main events)
- She **opened** the door and **walked** in.

### Past Continuous (background/setting)
- The sun **was shining**. Birds **were singing**.

### Past Perfect (earlier events)
- She realized she **had forgotten** her keys.

## Typical Pattern
1. Past Continuous: sets the scene
2. Simple Past: main action/interruption
3. Past Perfect: flashback to earlier event

## Example
*It **was raining** heavily (background). John **walked** into the café (main action). He **had been** there before (earlier experience).*
