# Semicolons

Semicolons (;) connect closely related ideas.

## Between Independent Clauses

Instead of a period, when ideas are closely related:
- *I love coffee; she prefers tea.*
- *It was raining; we stayed home.*
- *He studied hard; he passed the exam.*

## Before Conjunctive Adverbs

When using however, therefore, moreover, etc.:
- *I was tired; however, I finished the work.*
- *She's qualified; therefore, she got the job.*
- *It's expensive; nevertheless, I bought it.*

## In Complex Lists

When list items contain commas:
- *We visited Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Berlin, Germany.*
- *The team includes John, the captain; Sarah, the coach; and Mike, the manager.*

## NOT for These Uses

- ❌ Before a list (use colon)
- ❌ After incomplete sentences
- ❌ Before "because" or "although"

## Semicolon vs Comma

- Comma + conjunction: *I tried, but I failed.*
- Semicolon alone: *I tried; I failed.*
- Semicolon + adverb: *I tried; however, I failed.*

## Tip

If you can use a period, you can usually use a semicolon (but not vice versa).
