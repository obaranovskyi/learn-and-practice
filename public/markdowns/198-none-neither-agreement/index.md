# None, Neither (Agreement Rules)

## None

"None" can be singular or plural depending on context.

### Singular (traditional/formal)
- *None of the cake **is** left.*
- *None of the information **was** useful.*

### Plural (common, especially with countable)
- *None of the students **were** absent.*
- *None of them **have** arrived.*

### Rule of Thumb
- Uncountable → singular: *None of the water **is** clean.*
- Countable → often plural: *None of the books **are** here.*

## Neither

Usually **singular** when alone:
- ***Neither** answer **is** correct.*
- ***Neither** of them **knows**.*

### Neither...nor (nearest subject)
- *Neither the teacher **nor** the students **were** ready.*
- *Neither the students **nor** the teacher **was** ready.*

## Either

Similar to neither:
- ***Either** option **is** fine.*
- ***Either** of them **works**.*

### Either...or (nearest subject)
- *Either you **or** he **is** responsible.*
- *Either he **or** you **are** responsible.*
