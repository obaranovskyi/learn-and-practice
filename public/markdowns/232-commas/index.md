# Commas

Commas separate elements within sentences.

## Lists
- *I bought apples, oranges, and bananas.*
- *She is smart, funny, and kind.*

**Oxford comma**: The comma before "and" (optional but recommended)

## Before Coordinating Conjunctions
When joining independent clauses:
- *I wanted to go, but I was tired.*
- *She studied hard, so she passed.*

## After Introductory Elements
- *However, I disagree.*
- *In 2020, everything changed.*
- *Running late, she grabbed her keys.*

## With Non-Essential Information
- *My brother, who lives in London, is visiting.*
- *The book, which I bought yesterday, is great.*

## Addresses and Dates
- *She lives in Paris, France.*
- *On July 4, 1776, the declaration was signed.*

## Direct Address
- *John, can you help me?*
- *Yes, I can.*

## Separating Adjectives

- *She wore a beautiful red dress.* (no comma - cumulative)

## Common Mistakes
- ❌ I like coffee, and tea. (no comma needed)
