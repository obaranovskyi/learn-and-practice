# Not As...As / Not So...As

Use **not as...as** to show inequality (one is less than the other).

## Structure

**not as + adjective + as**

- *He is **not as tall as** his brother.*
  (= His brother is taller)
- *This test was **not as difficult as** the last one.*
  (= The last one was more difficult)

## Not So...As (Alternative)

In British English, **not so...as** is also used:
- *It's not so cold as yesterday.*
- *She's not so clever as she thinks.*

**Note**: "so...as" is only used in negatives; "as...as" works in both positive and negative.

## Meaning Comparison
