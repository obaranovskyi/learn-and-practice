# First Conditional

The First Conditional expresses real and possible situations in the future.

## Form

**If + Present Simple, will + base verb**

| If clause (condition) | Main clause (result) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| If it **rains** | I **will stay** home |
| If you **study** | you **will pass** |

## Structure

### Basic Form
- If + subject + **present simple**, subject + **will** + base verb

### Examples
- **If** it rains, I **will** take an umbrella.
- **If** you study hard, you **will** pass the exam.
- **If** she calls, I **will** answer.

### Reversed Order
The if-clause can come first or second:
- If it rains, I'll stay home. *(comma needed)*
- I'll stay home if it rains. *(no comma)*

## Uses

### 1. Real Future Possibilities
Things that are likely or possible to happen.

- If I have time, I'll help you.
- If the weather is nice, we'll go to the beach.
- If you don't hurry, you'll miss the bus.

### 2. Promises
- If you help me, I'll buy you dinner.
- I'll call you if I need anything.

### 3. Warnings / Threats
- If you touch that, you'll get hurt.
- If you don't stop, I'll call the police.

### 4. Offers
- If you're tired, I'll drive.
- I'll help you if you want.

## Variations

### Using Other Modals
You can replace "will" with other modals:

| Modal | Use | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **can** | ability | If you finish early, you can leave. |
| **may/might** | possibility | If it rains, we might cancel. |
| **should** | advice | If you feel sick, you should see a doctor. |
| **must** | necessity | If you want to pass, you must study. |

### Using Imperative
- If you see John, **tell** him to call me.
- **Call** me if you need help.

## Unless

**Unless = if not**

- I'll go **unless** it rains. = I'll go **if** it **doesn't** rain.
- **Unless** you study, you won't pass. = **If** you **don't** study, you won't pass.

## Common Mistakes

❌ If you will study, you will pass.  
✅ If you **study**, you will pass.

❌ I will go if it will not rain.
