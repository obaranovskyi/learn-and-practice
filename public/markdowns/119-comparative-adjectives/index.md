# Comparative Adjectives

Comparatives compare two things.

## Formation Rules

### Short Adjectives (1 syllable): Add -er
- *tall → taller*
- *fast → faster*
- *old → older*

### Spelling Changes
- **Consonant + y → ier**: *happy → happier*
- **Double final consonant**: *big → bigger, hot → hotter*
- **-e endings**: *nice → nicer, large → larger*

### Long Adjectives (2+ syllables): Use "more"
- *beautiful → more beautiful*
- *expensive → more expensive*
- *interesting → more interesting*

### Two-Syllable Adjectives (Both OK)
- *clever → cleverer / more clever*
- *simple → simpler / more simple*
- *quiet → quieter / more quiet*
- *narrow → narrower / more narrow*

## Structure

**Subject + be + comparative + than + object**
- *She is taller than me.*
- *This book is more interesting than that one.*

## Common Mistakes

- ✗ *more taller, more bigger*
- ✓ *taller, bigger*

- ✗ *intelligenter*
- ✓ *more intelligent*
