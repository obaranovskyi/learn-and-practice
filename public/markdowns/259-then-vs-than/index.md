# Then vs Than

Two words often confused due to similar spelling.

## Then = Time / Sequence

### Time reference
- *I was young **then**.*
- *We'll meet **then**.*
- *Back **then**, things were different.*

### Sequence (next)
- *First add flour, **then** add milk.*
- *We had dinner, **then** watched a movie.*
- *If you're tired, **then** rest.*

### In that case
- *If you don't like it, **then** don't buy it.*

## Than = Comparison

Used with comparatives:
- *She is taller **than** me.*
- *This is better **than** that.*
- *I'd rather walk **than** drive.*
- *More **than** 100 people came.*

## Memory Trick

- **Then** = time (both have "e")
- **Than** = comparison (think "comparison")

Or: **Than** is always comparing two things

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ *She is taller then me.*
- ✅ *She is taller than me.*
- ❌ *I'd rather stay home then go out.*
- ✅ *I'd rather stay home than go out.*
