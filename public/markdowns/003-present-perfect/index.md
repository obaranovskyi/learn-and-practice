# Present Perfect Simple

The Present Perfect connects the past to the present. It's used when a past action has a result or relevance now.

## Form

| I / You / We / They | have ('ve) | worked |
| He / She / It | has ('s) | worked |

### Negative
| Subject | Have/Has + not | Past Participle |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| I / You / We / They | have not (haven't) | worked |
| He / She / It | has not (hasn't) | worked |

### Question
| Have/Has | Subject | Past Participle |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Have | I/you/we/they | worked? |
| Has | he/she/it | worked? |

## Uses

### 1. Experiences (ever/never)

### 4. Actions Starting in Past and Continuing Now
With **for** (duration) and **since** (starting point).

- I **have lived** here for ten years.
- She **has worked** here since 2015.

### 5. Just, Already, Yet

| Word | Use | Position | Example |

| **already** | Sooner than expected | Before past participle | She **has already** left. |
| **yet** | Questions/negatives | End of sentence | Have you finished **yet**? |

## For vs Since

| FOR (duration) | SINCE (starting point) |
|----------------|------------------------|
| for two hours | since 2 o'clock |
| for three days | since Monday |
| for five years | since 2019 |
| for ages | since I was a child |

## Present Perfect vs Simple Past

| Present Perfect | Simple Past |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Unfinished time | Finished time |
| I've seen him today. | I saw him yesterday. |
| Result matters now | Just the fact |
| She's lost her phone. | She lost her phone last week. |

## Common Mistakes

❌ I have seen him yesterday.  
✅ I **saw** him yesterday. (finished time = Simple Past)

❌ I have lived here since 5 years.  
✅ I have lived here **for** 5 years.

❌ Did you ever visit Paris?  
✅ **Have** you ever **visited** Paris?

❌ She has went home.  
✅ She has **gone** home.
