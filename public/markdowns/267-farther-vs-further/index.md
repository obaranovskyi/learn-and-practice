# Farther vs Further

Traditional distinction: physical vs figurative.

## Farther (Physical Distance)

Measurable distance:
- *The store is **farther** than I thought.*
- *How much **farther** is it?*
- *We walked **farther** than yesterday.*
- *The **farther** shore was visible.*

## Further (Figurative/Additional)

Abstract distance or "more":
- *Let's discuss this **further**.*
- *I need **further** information.*
- *Without **further** delay...*
- ***Further**more,...* (in addition)

## Modern Usage

In practice, they're often **interchangeable** for distance:
- *The store is **further/farther** away.* (both OK)

But only **further** for figurative:
- ✅ *Let's discuss this **further**.*
- ❌ *Let's discuss this **farther**.*

## Memory Trick

- **Far**ther = **far** (physical)
- **Fur**ther = **fur**thermore (additional)

## Examples

| Physical (farther) | Figurative (further) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| farther away | further discussion |
| farther down the road | further details |
| farther north | further education |
| farther distance | further notice |

## Fixed Expressions

Only "further":
- until further notice
- further information
- further education
- furthermore
- further to (formal letter)
