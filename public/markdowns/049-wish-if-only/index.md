# I wish / If only

## Present wishes (wish + past simple)
- I **wish** I **had** more money. (I don't have enough)
- **If only** she **were** here.

## Past regrets (wish + past perfect)
- I **wish** I **had studied** harder. (I didn't)
- **If only** I **hadn't said** that.

## Wishes about behavior (wish + would)
- I **wish** he **would stop** smoking.
- **If only** it **would stop** raining.

## Note
- "If only" is stronger/more emotional than "I wish"
- Use "were" instead of "was" (formal)
