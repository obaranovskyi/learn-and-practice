# Its vs It's

One of the most common mistakes in English.

## It's = It is / It has

Contraction (apostrophe shows missing letters):
- ***It's** raining.* = It is raining
- ***It's** been a long day.* = It has been
- ***It's** cold outside.* = It is cold
- ***It's** nice to meet you.* = It is nice

## Its = Possession

Belonging to "it" (no apostrophe):
- *The cat licked **its** paw.*
- *The company changed **its** policy.*
- *The tree lost **its** leaves.*
- *Every country has **its** traditions.*

## Memory Trick

**Test**: Can you replace with "it is" or "it has"?
- ✅ Yes → Use **it's**
- ❌ No → Use **its**

## Examples

| Sentence | Test | Correct |
|----------|------|---------|
| ___ raining | It is raining ✅ | It's |
| The dog wagged ___ tail | It is tail ❌ | its |
| ___ been great | It has been ✅ | It's |
| The book lost ___ cover | It is cover ❌ | its |

## Why No Apostrophe for Possession?

Possessive pronouns never have apostrophes:
- his, hers, yours, theirs, ours, **its**
- ❌ her's, your's, their's, it's (for possession)

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ *The dog wagged it's tail.*
- ✅ *The dog wagged its tail.*
- ❌ *Its a beautiful day.*
- ✅ *It's a beautiful day.*
