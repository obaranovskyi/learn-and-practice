# Subject-Verb Agreement

The verb must agree with the subject in number (singular/plural).

## Basic Rule

- **Singular subject** → singular verb: *She **works**.*
- **Plural subject** → plural verb: *They **work**.*

## Tricky Cases

### Compound Subjects with "and"
- Usually plural: *John **and** Mary **are** here.*
- Exception (one unit): *Bread and butter **is** my breakfast.*

### Or/Nor (Nearest Subject)
- *Neither the teacher **nor** the students **were** ready.*
- *Either the students **or** the teacher **was** late.*

### Prepositional Phrases
Ignore phrases between subject and verb:
- *The box **of chocolates is** (not are) on the table.*
- *The students **in this class are** smart.*

### Indefinite Pronouns

| Singular | Plural | Both |
|----------|--------|------|
| everyone, everybody | few, many | all, some |
| anyone, anybody | both, several | most, none |
| someone, somebody | | any |
| each, either, neither | | |
| nothing, everything | | |

### Collective Nouns
- Singular (unit): *The team **is** winning.*
- Plural (individuals): *The team **are** arguing.* (BrE)

## Common Mistakes

- ✗ *Everyone are here.*
- ✓ *Everyone **is** here.*

- ✗ *The news are bad.*
- ✓ *The news **is** bad.*
