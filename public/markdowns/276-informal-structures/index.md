# Informal Structures

Grammar patterns common in casual speech.

## Gonna/Wanna/Gotta

- *gonna* = going to → "I'm gonna leave."
- *wanna* = want to → "I wanna go home."
- *gotta* = got to/have to → "I gotta run."
- *kinda* = kind of → "It's kinda cold."
- *sorta* = sort of → "I sorta agree."
- *outta* = out of → "I'm outta here."
- *shoulda/coulda/woulda* = should have/could have/would have

## Informal Word Order

### Fronting for emphasis
- *That movie, I really liked it.*
- *Pizza, I could eat every day.*

### Right dislocation
- *She's nice, that woman.*
- *It's good, this coffee.*

## Informal Negatives

- *ain't* = am not/is not/are not/have not
- "I ain't going." (very informal)
- Double negatives (non-standard): "I don't know nothing."

## Questions without Inversion

- *You're coming?* (rising intonation)
- *He said what?* (echo question)
- *She's leaving when?*

## Get Passive (Informal)

- *get + past participle*
- "I got fired." (vs "I was fired")
- "They got married." (vs "They were married")

## Informal Intensifiers

- *really* / *so* / *totally*
- *super* / *way* / *dead* (British)
- "It's way better." / "I'm totally exhausted."

- Formal documents
- Job interviews (mostly)
